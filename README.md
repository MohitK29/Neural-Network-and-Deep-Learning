# Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning

1 - Logistics Regression
Training Logistic Regression Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with acccuracy around 70%

2 - Step by step implementation of creating Deep Neural Network.

3 - Planar Data Classification using neural network with a single hidden layer
Training the Model to detect different color lines on the graph

4 - N-Layered Deep Neural Network Application (Leveraging ReLU and Sigmoid Activation Fxn)
Training Deep Neural Network Model to detect whether the image has cat or not with a higher accuracy than the logistic regression model
Step by step implementation of creating Deep Neural Network.
